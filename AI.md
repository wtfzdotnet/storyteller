## Project Context

The **Recipe Authority Platform** is "The Authority of Recipes on the Internet" - a sophisticated recipe intelligence platform built with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. We're solving the chaotic landscape of web recipes by creating authoritative, structured knowledge that transforms how people discover, plan, and cook meals.

### Core Mission
Transform inconsistent web recipes into authoritative, cultural-aware, nutritionally-accurate knowledge that reduces food waste and enhances cooking experiences worldwide.

### Technical Foundation
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** with **Hexagonal Architecture**
- **PHP 8.4** with **Symfony 7.x** and **API Platform 4.0**
- **Event-driven architecture** with **CQRS** patterns
- **Progressive bounded contexts**: Recipe ï¿½ Nutrition ï¿½ User ï¿½ Inventory ï¿½ MealPlanning ï¿½ Shopping ï¿½ Cultural

- **Domain-Specific Guidance**: Specialized knowledge for recipe platform context

## Using the AI Expert Team

### Story Development Process

1. **Initial Analysis**: Multiple expert roles analyze new stories from their perspectives
2. **Iterative Feedback**: Experts provide domain-specific feedback and refinements
3. **Consensus Building**: Agreement checking across relevant expert perspectives
4. **Finalization**: Comprehensive story analysis with multi-perspective insights
5. **User Approval**: Final validation before development begins

### Role Selection Strategy

**For Recipe Features**: Domain Expert (Food & Nutrition), Professional Chef, Registered Dietitian
**For Technical Architecture**: System Architect, Lead Developer, Security Expert
**For User Experience**: UX/UI Designer, Product Owner, relevant nutrition specialists
**For Cultural Features**: Food Historian/Anthropologist, Cultural domain experts
**For Performance/Scaling**: DevOps Engineer, System Architect, Lead Developer

### Repository-Based Prompts

The AI system can leverage this documentation structure for enhanced, context-aware responses:

```bash
# Enable repository-based prompts for story creation
python -m ai_core.main story create "Add cultural recipe validation" \
  --roles "Food Historian/Anthropologist,Security Expert,Product Owner" \
  --use-repository-prompts
```

This approach ensures AI responses are:
- **Contextually Aware**: Understanding of the recipe domain and platform goals
- **Role-Specific**: Reflecting each expert's documented responsibilities and focus areas
- **Culturally Sensitive**: Incorporating cultural awareness and respect
- **Technically Accurate**: Aligned with established architecture and patterns
