## ü§ñ GitHub Copilot & Enhanced MCP Integration

### Overview

The Recipe Authority Platform now features deep integration with GitHub Copilot and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling seamless, AI-powered story management and expert collaboration directly from your development environment or AI assistant. This integration empowers developers and teams to:
- Automate story creation, analysis, and distribution across repositories
- Leverage 20+ expert AI roles for domain-specific insights and validation
- Interact with the platform via standardized MCP endpoints for Copilot, LLMs, and custom tools
- Ensure secure, high-performance, and auditable workflows for enterprise and open-source teams

### Expert Roles in Copilot/MCP Workflows
- **Automated Multi-Expert Analysis**: Every story is reviewed by relevant expert roles, ensuring professional, culturally-sensitive, and technically-sound outcomes
- **Role Documentation**: Each expert role is fully documented in [AI Expert Team Documentation](/.storyteller/README.md) and discoverable via `role/list`
- **Customizable Workflows**: Developers can specify which expert roles to involve per story or query
- **Consensus & Validation**: Copilot and MCP workflows leverage expert consensus for higher quality and reliability

### Further Reading & Integration
- See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for endpoint usage examples, configuration, and troubleshooting
