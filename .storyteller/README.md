## Multi-Repository Configuration

This project supports both single repository and multi-repository modes for managing user stories across backend and frontend components.

### Configuration Structure

The multi-repository configuration is defined in `.storyteller/config.json`:

```json
{
  "repositories": {
    "backend": {
      "name": "project/backend",
      "type": "backend", 
      "description": "Backend API and services",
      "dependencies": [],
      "story_labels": ["backend", "api"]
    },
    "frontend": {
      "name": "project/frontend",
      "type": "frontend",
      "description": "User interface and client applications", 
      "dependencies": ["backend"],
      "story_labels": ["frontend", "ui"]
    }
  },
  "default_repository": "backend",
  "story_workflow": {
    "create_subtickets": true,
    "respect_dependencies": true
  }
}
```

### Multi-Repository Commands

#### List Available Repositories
```bash
python main.py story list-repositories
```

#### Create Story in Specific Repository
```bash
python main.py story create "User authentication system" --repository backend
```

#### Create Stories Across Multiple Repositories
```bash
python main.py story create-multi "User dashboard with API" --repos backend,frontend
```

### Dependency Management

The system automatically handles repository dependencies:
- Stories are created in dependency order (backend before frontend)
- Cross-repository references are added automatically
- Dependency information is included in story prompts

### Environment Variables

For backward compatibility, single repository mode is still supported via environment variables:
- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repo` - Single repository mode
- `GITHUB_TOKEN=token` - Required for GitHub API access
