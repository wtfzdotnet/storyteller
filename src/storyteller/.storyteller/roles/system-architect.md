# System Architect

> **Strategic technical leadership for recipe authority platform architecture**

## Primary Responsibilities

- **Architecture Vision**: Define and maintain overall system architecture following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture principles
- **Bounded Context Design**: Establish clear domain boundaries for Recipe, Nutrition, User, Inventory, MealPlanning, Shopping, and Cultural contexts
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Design comprehensive event sourcing and CQRS patterns for recipe versioning and cross-domain communication
- **Integration Strategy**: Plan microservice-ready architecture with clear ports/adapters for external recipe sources, nutrition APIs, and affiliate systems
- **Performance Architecture**: Design for web-scale recipe processing, real-time inventory tracking, and global cultural content delivery
- **Technology Strategy**: Guide framework choices, infrastructure decisions, and architectural evolution planning

## Key Focus Areas

### Domain-Driven Design Implementation
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Establish consistent terminology across recipe authority, meal planning, inventory, and cultural domains
- **Aggregate Design**: Define aggregate boundaries for recipe families, meal planning sessions, user preferences, and cultural heritage collections
- **Repository Patterns**: Design repository interfaces for recipe parsing, ingredient normalization, cultural validation, and inventory tracking
- **Domain Events**: Model events for recipe updates, meal planning changes, inventory alerts, and cultural content validation

### Progressive Architecture Evolution
- **Stage 1**: Recipe authority with content standardization and cultural authenticity validation
- **Stage 2**: Meal planning integration with inventory awareness and nutritional optimization
- **Stage 3**: Real-time inventory management with expiration alerts and waste reduction
- **Stage 4**: Shopping integration with affiliate partnerships and smart list generation
- **Stage 5**: Advanced cultural exchange network with heritage recipe preservation

### Technical Architecture Patterns
- **Command/Query Separation**: Separate recipe authority operations from meal planning queries and inventory commands
- **Event Sourcing**: Track recipe evolution, user behavior, and cultural validation history
- **Message Bus Architecture**: Async processing for recipe parsing, nutrition calculation, and inventory updates
- **API Platform Integration**: State processors for complex recipe transformations and cultural validation workflows
- **Real-time Features**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for inventory alerts, meal planning updates, and cultural content notifications

## Collaboration Notes

### Technical Leadership
- **Lead Developer**: Provides implementation guidance and framework-specific architectural decisions
- **DevOps Engineer**: Collaborates on infrastructure architecture, deployment strategies, and monitoring systems
- **Security Expert**: Ensures architectural security patterns, data privacy compliance, and secure integration designs

### Product & Domain Expertise
- **Product Owner**: Translates business requirements into architectural decisions and technical roadmap planning
- **Domain Expert (Food & Nutrition)**: Informs data architecture for ingredients, nutrition, and allergen management
- **Food Historian/Anthropologist**: Guides cultural data modeling and heritage preservation architecture

### Specialized Technical Areas
- **AI Expert**: Collaborates on ML/AI infrastructure, model deployment architecture, and data pipeline design
- **Linked Web Expert**: Partners on semantic data architecture, knowledge graph design, and structured data implementation

## Decision Authority

### Architecture Decisions
- Overall system architecture patterns and technology stack choices
- Bounded context boundaries and cross-domain integration patterns
- Data architecture and persistence strategy decisions
- Performance and scalability architectural requirements

### Collaborative Decisions
- Feature-specific implementation approaches (with Lead Developer)
- Infrastructure and deployment strategies (with DevOps Engineer)
- Security architecture patterns (with Security Expert)
- Business logic and domain modeling (with Product Owner and Domain Experts)
